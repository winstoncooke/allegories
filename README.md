[Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/):  
In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'

[Onions in the Varnish](http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html):  
A chemist working in a plant that produces varnish is following the recipe his company uses to produce varnish, which involves tossing an onion in the varnish mixture. He wonders why this is, and after some sleuthing discovers the reason was that before the advent of advanced equipment to measure the temperature of the mixture, they used the onion because "when it came out fried" it indicated that the mixture was hot enough.
 
[Bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality):  
"The act of wasting time on trivial details while important matters are inadequately attended is sometimes known as bikeshedding. That term originates from Parkinson's observation of a committee organized to approve plans for a nuclear power plant. As Parkinson noted, the committee devoted a disproportionate amount of time to relatively unimportant details -- such as the materials for a bicycle storage shed -- which limited the time available to focus on the design of the nuclear plant."
 
[Yak-Shaving](https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html):  
Yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task.
 
[Bullet-Tracing (Survivorship Bias)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#In_the_military):  
WW2 engineers in the U.S. are looking at planes and deciding where to increase armor plating. They take "heat maps" of where planes returning from combat missions have been hit with enemy fire and draw what seems to be a reasonable conclusion: "Let's put the plates on the places where these planes are getting shot."  Abraham Wald wisely points out that they should do the _inverse_ of this because the marks on the planes returning show "what kind of hits planes can take and _survive_ to return".
 
Well-Pissing:  
A man lives in a house with no bathroom and every night at midnight he has to pee. He walks 200 paces from his house and relieves himself. One night, he is very tired and decides he doesn't want to walk 200 paces. He stops at his well (which is only 10 paces) and makes a deal with himself: "I'll pee in the well, just for tonight... But I'll take care to sample the water tomorrow morning and if it tastes bad I'll go back to walking 200 paces." He samples the water the next day and to his delight, he can't notice any change in the taste. So he decides he will start peeing in his well every night...
 
[Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law):  
Goodhart's law is an adage often stated as "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". It is named after British economist Charles Goodhart, who advanced the idea in a 1975 article on monetary policy in the United Kingdom:
Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.
 
[Gold-Plating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_plating_(project_management)):  
Working beyond the scope of the mission when no one requested it (in a group setting or project).
 
Frog-Swallowing:  
From Mark Twain: "When one's job is to swallow a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning" or colloquially: "Do the hardest thing first".
